# GSV List Tracker ![](https://github.com/juanpisuribe13/gsv-list-tracker/actions/workflows/automate.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

Tracks down every change made on the [Google Street View 
Driving List](https://www.google.com/streetview/explore/#sv-headed) 
starting from April 2nd, 2022.

Please keep in mind that this tracker is not a reliable way 
to determine where Google will update its Street View service 
worldwide. There have been cases where updates have occurred 
in specific countries that were not previously listed, such 
as Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, Panama, Peru, and others.
