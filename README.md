Hello, how can I contact you? If possible can you dm me on Discord (deuces#1961).

I have a question about the gist you created that detects recent users (https://gist.github.com/juanpisss/3972f188cbabed60c32e2b55c115397f#file-recentrobloxusers-py), basically could you send me the original rbxlua file made by 1waffle1 please? I would highly appreciate it thanks. 

You can send here or on Discord. 
Sorry for bothering and thanks in advance!
